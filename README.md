# Getting started

Before anything, you need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

After installing those, you'll be able to start contributing to this project.

# Starting the application

It's as easy as:

```bash
$ make build
```

And then...

```bash
$ make up
```

And after you download all the necessary dependencies the application will be running locally.

And you can execute without showing any logs with:
```bash
$ (sudo) docker-compose up -d
```
